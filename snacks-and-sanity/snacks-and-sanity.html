    <title>The Crab with Porphyria: A Tale of Snacks and Sanity</title>

    <h1>The Crab with Porphyria: A Tale of Snacks and Sanity</h1>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there was a crab named Carl who suffered from porphyria, a condition that made him sensitive to sunlight and caused him to have acute attacks when his glucose levels were low. Carl was always forgetful when it came to eating and often went hours without food, which often led to him having an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Carl was out foraging for food when he suddenly forgot to eat for several hours. His glucose levels dropped dangerously low, and he started to feel woozy and confused. As he stumbled around the beach, he suddenly had an acute porphyria attack that caused him to have a complete mental breakdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl began to behave erratically, speaking in tongues and jumping around like a maniac. He began to see things that weren't there, such as giant seagulls and dancing clams. The other crabs on the beach were terrified of him and kept their distance, afraid that his madness might be contagious.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Carl's episode continued, he suddenly had an epiphany. He realized that he needed to take better care of himself and his porphyria. From that day on, he carried a snack with him at all times and set reminders on his phone to eat regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly but surely, Carl began to recover from his acute attack and his psychiatric problems. He started to see the world in a new light, realizing that he needed to take better care of himself to avoid any future episodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he sat on the beach, munching on a delicious piece of seaweed, Carl knew that he had learned an important lesson. The key to staying sane with porphyria was to stay well-fed and well-organized. And with that, he went back to his life, enjoying the simple pleasures of the sea and the sun, with a newfound sense of peace and clarity.
