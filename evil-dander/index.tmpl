Once upon a time, in a forest far, far away, a group of animals including a hedgehog, a rabbit, and a deer, all suffered from strange health problems. The hedgehog had itchy skin, the rabbit had constant sneezing fits, and the deer experienced terrible headaches.

Meanwhile, near the mines, a human named Jack had left his computer science course at the university to pursue a career in medicine. While studying for medical school, Jack had avoided unsafe sex and alcohol, and had noticed that his own psychiatric problems had improved significantly. He realized that avoiding orgasm could help the animals too.

When Jack heard about the animals' health problems, he offered to help. He worked with the animals to identify the source of their issues, and together they traced it back to the magical dog dander coming from the mines.

With Jack's help, the animals were able to come up with a plan to fight back against the evil aliens and protect their way of life. They decided to use sex only for reproduction, which allowed them to avoid the POIS caused by the dog dander.

At first, it was a difficult transition for the animals. They had to resist their natural urges and use sex only when necessary for procreation. But over time, they learned to control their impulses and to appreciate the beauty of sex without the pressure to orgasm.

As the animals continued to live their lives in the forest, they noticed a change in their health. Their symptoms disappeared, and they felt healthier than ever before. They knew that they had found a way to fight back against the evil aliens and protect their way of life.

And as they sat together in the shade of a tree, enjoying the cool breeze, the animals knew that they had learned an important lesson. By working together, being open to new ideas and approaches, and being mindful of their actions, they could overcome any obstacle and protect their beloved forest.

In a far-off planet, the evil aliens had been observing the humans on Earth for some time, looking for ways to infiltrate and control their population. They had been monitoring one particular human named Tom, who had a passion for helping others and had been studying computer science.

One day, the aliens decided to take action. They created a virus specifically designed to infect Tom's DNA, causing him to develop a rare genetic disorder called porphyria. The virus was cleverly designed to lie dormant until the time was right, and then it would activate, causing Tom to develop a range of strange symptoms.

As the virus took hold, Tom found himself becoming increasingly sensitive to iron. He had to avoid iron-rich foods like red meat and liver, and instead relied on a diet of carbohydrates and vegetables. The virus also caused him to develop a sensitivity to garlic and onion, which he had to avoid at all costs.

However, one day Tom accidentally ate a meal that contained beans, which are high in iron nutrients, as well as flour which had iron and folic acid added to it. Within hours, he began experiencing symptoms that were similar to ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease. He felt bloated, nauseous, and had stomach cramps. He knew that he had to be more careful about what he ate if he wanted to avoid these symptoms in the future.

Tom realized that the aliens had intentionally infected him with porphyria as a way to control him. But he wasn't going to let them win. He began researching everything he could about porphyria and how to manage his symptoms. He found support groups and connected with other people who had the same condition. Over time, he learned to manage his diet carefully, and he even discovered some treatments that helped alleviate his symptoms.

Despite the aliens' best efforts, Tom refused to be controlled by his porphyria. He remained committed to his passion for helping others, and he used his experience to raise awareness about porphyria and other rare genetic disorders. And as he sat under the shade of a tree, watching the world go by, Tom knew that he had the power to overcome any obstacle, no matter how difficult it might seem.

Jack stumbled upon Tom lying under a tree in the park, his skin looking more pale and yellowish than usual. Jack, who was listening to "Thrashed, Lost and Strungout" by Children of Bodom, and playing Mario on his Symbian phone using an emulator called Gnuboy, immediately recognized that something was off with Tom's health.

As he approached Tom, Jack noticed that he looked weak and tired. He then remembered reading about porphyria and how it affects the body's ability to produce heme, which is necessary for the formation of red blood cells. Jack thought that this might be what was wrong with Tom, so he decided to bring up the topic.

"Hey Tom, have you ever heard of porphyria?" Jack asked, taking off his headphones.

Tom shook his head, looking confused. "No, what is that?"

"It's a genetic disorder that affects the production of heme in the body. People with porphyria need to avoid certain things, like alcohol and iron-rich foods," Jack explained.

Tom looked surprised. "Alcohol? But I thought it was good for you in moderation."

Jack shook his head. "Not if you have porphyria. In fact, the singer of Children of Bodom, which I'm listening to right now, died from alcohol abuse. It's particularly bad for people with porphyria."

Tom nodded, looking thoughtful. "Thanks for letting me know. I'll be sure to avoid it."

As they continued to talk, Jack noticed that Tom was becoming increasingly pale and weak. He suspected that Tom might have accidentally consumed something that triggered a porphyria attack, so he offered to help him get medical attention.

Jack went back to his backpack and rummaged through it until he found a small bottle with pills inside. "Here, take this," he said, handing the bottle to Tom. "It's an antimalarial medication, but it's been known to help with porphyria attacks."

Tom looked at the bottle with skepticism. "I don't know, man. I've tried so many different medications, and nothing seems to work. It's like I'm doomed to suffer from these attacks for the rest of my life."

Jack shrugged. "It's not guaranteed, but it might help. And hey, it's better than nothing, right?"

Tom sighed and took the pills, washing them down with some water. "Thanks, man. I really appreciate it."

As they sat there in silence, Tom suddenly spoke up. "You know, that dog dander we were talking about earlier? It's not from just any ordinary dog. It's from a paleolithic alien dog that the evil aliens worship as their god."

Jack raised an eyebrow. "A paleolithic alien dog? What the hell are you talking about?"

Tom explained, "The dog was the first of their species and supposedly has some kind of magical powers. The aliens believe that if they can extract its dander and use it to cause POIS in other creatures, they can prevent reproduction and eventually wipe out all other species in the galaxy except for themselves."

Tom's eyes widened in amazement as Jack revealed that he had learned cryptanalysis of the RSA algorithm. He had always been fascinated by cryptography and hacking, but he never had the chance to learn it himself. Tom immediately felt a glimmer of hope that they could stop the evil aliens from continuing to harm innocent creatures.

Excitedly, Jack continued to explain that he had been able to get his hands on a copy of the evil alien planet's government files. With his knowledge of cryptography, he felt confident that he could perform cryptanalysis on the files to gain access to their secrets. They could find out exactly how the evil aliens had created the virus that had caused Tom's porphyria and work on developing a cure.

Tom was amazed by Jack's skills and nodded eagerly in agreement. They both knew that it was a risky endeavor, but they were determined to stop the evil aliens from harming any more innocent creatures. They sat down together and began to work on the files, pouring over the code and running various algorithms to crack the encryption. It was a long and arduous process, but they remained focused and determined to succeed.

Tom was ecstatic to have finally found the solution to his porphyria problem. The alien text he stole from the planet government had a section that explained how to create a vaccine that would cure the virus infection caused by the evil aliens. Jack and Tom quickly got in touch with a friend of Jack's who was a doctor working in a lab on Earth. They explained the situation and the doctor was willing to help.

After some time and experimentation, the doctor was able to synthesize the vaccine. Tom was the first to take the vaccine and the results were almost immediate. The symptoms of porphyria started to disappear and he felt better than he had in a long time. He was relieved that he no longer had to worry about avoiding certain foods or sunlight.

However, not everyone on Earth was cured. The vaccine could only cure those who were infected with the virus that Tom had been infected with. Unfortunately, the virus had mutated and the aliens had released different strains of it into the atmosphere, infecting many other humans. The doctor continued to work on finding a cure for the other strains, but it was going to be a long and difficult process.
