        <h1>The Healing Power of a Cactus</h1>
        <h2>by Mateus de Lima Oliveira</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who lived in Brazil. He suffered from porphyria and oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy. Despite his physical and mental health issues, he was a successful businessman and philanthropist.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Jack's life took a dark turn when he became the suspect of being part of an international cartel of pedophilia. Interpol started investigating him, but he vehemently denied any involvement. He knew he was innocent, but the allegations alone were enough to ruin his reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, the Brazilian intelligence community was investigating him for betrayal, spying, and money laundering. They believed that he was using his business ventures as a cover-up for his illicit activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack's troubles didn't end there. His porphyria and OAS were taking a toll on his body, and he was experiencing severe bowel inflammation, skin blisters, and psychiatric problems. Despite his condition, he tried to prove his innocence, but no one was willing to listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack was summoned to the psychiatric hospital, where he was informed that he had read secret files that he was not supposed to. The only way to erase those memories from his brain was through electroconvulsive therapy, which is known to permanently erase memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his protests, Jack was strapped to a table, and the procedure began. The pain was excruciating, and he felt as if his brain was being fried. But when it was over, he couldn't remember anything about the files he had read.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the side effects of the therapy were severe. He couldn't think straight, and his memory was hazy. He struggled to remember even the simplest things, like his own name.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add insult to injury, the Brazilian justice system imposed a covert monetary and sexual boycott against him, making it impossible for him to leave the country. He was trapped, isolated, and alone, with no one to turn to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack was determined to clear his name, no matter what it took. He used his remaining strength to fight against the false allegations, the investigations, and the covert operations. And eventually, he was able to prove his innocence.
        </p>
        <p>
          After struggling with oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy for a long time, Jack finally decided to consult an allergist. The allergist recommended that Jack undergo skin prick tests to determine which foods he was allergic to. After the tests, it was found that Jack was highly allergic to apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, nectarines, prunes, kiwi, carrots, celery, potatoes, peppers, fennel, parsley, coriander, parsnips, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts. The allergist informed Jack that these foods were cross-reactive with birch pollen and were triggering his OAS. The doctor recommended that Jack avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to avoid any adverse reactions. Jack was relieved to have finally found out which foods to avoid, and he left the clinic feeling hopeful and empowered to take control of his health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack, who had been suffering from oral allergy syndrome due to birch pollen allergy, decided to do some research on his own. He searched on Google and asked ChatGPT which foods to avoid to prevent an OAS flare-up. He discovered that apples, pears, and hazelnuts were cross-reactive with birch pollen and could trigger his OAS. Jack was relieved to have found the answer on his own and decided to avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to prevent any adverse reactions. With the help of the internet and ChatGPT, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and make informed decisions to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack went to his book club meeting with his girlfriend. They were discussing the novel Dracula, and his girlfriend suggested that Jack read the book. After the meeting, Jack was curious and decided to do some research on Dracula. He went on Wikipedia and found out that if Dracula were a real person, he could have had porphyria, just like Jack. Jack was surprised and intrigued, and he continued his research.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he delved deeper into the topic, he learned that one of the triggers for porphyria was an excess of iron in the diet. He realized that he had been consuming foods rich in iron, such as beans, which were common in Brazilian cuisine, and flour with added iron and folic acid. Jack knew he had to change his diet to manage his porphyria, so he started avoiding foods high in iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few weeks, Jack noticed that the blisters on his skin had stopped showing up. He felt relieved and grateful that he had done his research and made the necessary changes to his diet. He was proud of himself for taking control of his health and using the knowledge he had gained to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stress of being investigated by the intelligence community of Brazil took a toll on Jack's health, and he began experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia. He knew he had to take action to manage his condition, so he turned to Google for answers. Through his research, he discovered that SNRI medications, such as desvenlafaxine, were effective in treating fibromyalgia. Jack brought this information to his psychiatrist and requested a prescription for desvenlafaxine.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of the medication, Jack's symptoms began to improve, and he felt more like himself again. He knew that managing his stress and taking care of his mental health were essential for managing his fibromyalgia, and he was grateful for the resources and support that allowed him to do so. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack remained determined to take control of his health and find a path to healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack had always loved the cactus his girlfriend had given him in their book club meeting, and he made sure to water it regularly. However, Jack's life took an unexpected turn when he became the subject of a financial and social media reach boycott. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack refused to let the negativity affect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, he focused on his cactus and the simple pleasure it brought him. Watering the cactus became a routine for Jack, and he found the act calming and therapeutic. As he tended to the plant, Jack felt a sense of peace and stability wash over him. The cactus represented something pure and positive in his life, a reminder that there was still goodness and beauty in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the ups and downs, Jack remained mentally strong and resilient. He knew that the boycott and other challenges would pass, but his love for his cactus would remain constant. In the midst of the chaos, Jack found solace in the little things, and he emerged from the experience with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for life's simple pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his initial suspicion that his symptoms were caused by porphyria, Jack found that his condition continued to worsen even after he had made the necessary dietary changes. His skin blisters persisted, and he continued to experience severe bowel inflammation and psychiatric problems. As he began to research further, he realized that there were a number of other conditions that could potentially explain his symptoms. It became clear that he needed to consult a doctor and undergo further testing to determine the root cause of his health issues. With a renewed sense of determination, Jack set out to get to the bottom of his condition and find a solution that would help him regain his health and wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack delved deeper into the events that had caused his health to deteriorate, he began to suspect that something more sinister was at play. The fact that agents from the government had convinced his mother to add colorless, sugar-free gelatin to his sugar bowl in an effort to reduce his blood sugar levels seemed suspicious to him. After all, he had pre-diabetes and had been managing his condition well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he connected the dots, Jack began to suspect that this was an act of sabotage by an unfriendly intelligence agency. It was possible that they had deliberately targeted him in an effort to compromise his health and interfere with his life. Though he had no concrete evidence to support his theory, the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fit together in a way that made sense to him. With this knowledge, Jack vowed to remain vigilant and protect himself from any further attempts at sabotage.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack continued his research into the possible causes of his symptoms, he began to delve deeper into the world of food sensitivities and allergies. He discovered that people with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, cannot eat collagen either. This was a significant revelation for him, as he had suspected that his symptoms were related to porphyria, which was not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his gluten and collagen sensitivities, Jack also found that he had an intolerance to casein, a protein found in dairy products, as well as legumin, a molecule similar to casein found in legumes. These sensitivities helped explain some of his digestive issues and other symptoms, such as fatigue and inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at himself in the mirror, Jack couldn't help but notice that he was quite thin, short, and had an appearance that was reminiscent of an alien. This realization led him to wonder if there was something more to his condition than just food sensitivities. As he continued to reflect, he began to wonder if he might be on the autism spectrum, a condition that often manifests with sensory sensitivities and dietary restrictions similar to those he was experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this new perspective, Jack began to explore the possibility that he was an "autist alien," a term that he came up with to describe his unique combination of sensitivities and traits. He felt that he was beginning to understand himself in a way that he had not before. Armed with this knowledge, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and wellbeing and find ways to manage his condition in a way that allowed him to live his best life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taurine is an amino acid that is essential for many bodily functions, including cardiovascular function and the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. When Jack noticed that his diet was poor in taurine, he began to experience symptoms such as his retina losing pigmentation and his teeth becoming brittle. To address this issue, Jack began drinking a large can of energy drink containing taurine once a week. As a result, he started feeling mentally better and more alert. Additionally, taurine plays a role in the production of bile, which is important for digestion. The improvement in his digestion was noticeable after he started supplementing with taurine. Later on, Jack checked his phone and noticed that he had little "Alien Bucks", which was the currency of his species. These Alien Bucks were essential for preventing economic boycott by the unfriendly intelligence, who were known for engaging in sabotage and other harmful practices against those they deemed a threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I.M., an alien who had been battling the unfriendly intelligence for decades, had tragically died of suicide by hanging. Jack had known Ian when he was a kid, and Ian had always been a mentor to him. One day, Ian had shared a secret with Jack about how to activate the alien mode on his operating system. All Jack had to do was type "apt-get moo" in the terminal. The typical output of this command on the Debian operating system was a whimsical message. For example, "Have you mooed today?" or "The cow says moo." Ian had always been a bit of a prankster, but Jack knew that his advice to type this command was more than just a joke. It was a way to connect with their alien heritage and to remember the struggle against the unfriendly intelligence. Jack never forgot I.M.'s words, and he typed the command from time to time to remind himself of his friend and their shared mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack exclaimed with frustration that I.M. was not simply a victim of suicide but was actually "suicided" by the unfriendly intelligence. He explained that Ian had been manipulated and induced to take large amounts of benzodiazepines, alcohol, and anti-psychotics, which are central nervous system depressants. Jack believed that this was a deliberate effort by the unfriendly intelligence to eliminate I.M. and his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alien working for the European intelligence had been conducting extensive research on the various medications available on Earth that could alleviate the anxious and restless feelings that aliens often experienced. After conducting numerous studies, the alien found that SNRI, a medication used to treat depression, anxiety, and panic disorders, was an effective treatment for these symptoms. However, it was too late for I.M. as he had already been forced to suicide by the unfriendly intelligence. This discovery shook Jack to his core, and he vowed to never take CNS depressants again and to opt for SNRI instead. He believed that this would not only help him deal with the difficulties of living on Earth but also potentially prevent him from meeting the same fate as I.M.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was lost in his own thoughts, walking down the street, when suddenly a verse from a song stuck in his head burst out of his mouth: "I.M. the supervisor, give me the tax number." He stopped and looked around, embarrassed that he had accidentally sung out loud. The words were from an old song that he had heard as a child, and he hadn't thought about it in years. The verse seemed to be a strange coincidence, as it was the initials of the recently deceased I.M. Jack couldn't shake off the feeling that it meant something, but he didn't know what.

          Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique used to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. It is a widely used technique in molecular biology research, medical diagnostics, and forensic analysis. Jack remembers that he had built a PCR machine when he was about 16 years old using instructions he found on the internet. However, due to the electroconvulsive therapy that he was forced to undergo in a psychiatric hospital, he completely forgot about it. PCR technology was still in its early stages back then, and the availability of the internet allowed Jack to access the information he needed to build his own machine. Despite having no formal education in molecular biology, Jack was able to build a functioning PCR machine, which he used to amplify specific DNA sequences for various purposes. Now that he has remembered this, he wonders if he can use his skills in molecular biology to help him in his current situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was fascinated with the idea of sequencing his own DNA, so he collected a sample of genetic material from his saliva and sent it to his friend who was studying genetics in another country. Jack's friend had access to a PCR machine, which is a device used to amplify a specific segment of DNA, making it possible to study it more closely. The first step was to extract DNA from Jack's sample and then amplify a specific segment of it using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR process involved heating and cooling the DNA to create multiple copies of the target DNA region. After amplification, Jack's friend used a technique called Sanger sequencing to determine the sequence of his DNA. Sanger sequencing involves labeling DNA fragments and separating them by size through a gel electrophoresis process. The resulting DNA sequence data was then analyzed, and Jack's friend was able to provide him with a report that showed the sequence of his DNA, including any genetic variations or mutations he may have had. Jack was fascinated by the results and spent hours reading about the different genes and traits that were present in his DNA.

          Jack and his friend from another country were concerned about the privacy of Jack's DNA sequence data, so they decided to negotiate a <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> encryption to secure the transfer. They both downloaded and installed the GnuPG software and exchanged their public keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="cell margin-xy">

    <div class="grid-x grid-margin-xy grid-padding-xy">
      <div class="cell margin-xy">
        <p>
          After negotiating the encryption, Jack's friend sent him the DNA sequence data through a local Apache HTTP server and PHP running on Jack's local machine, which was running on a non-standard TCP port. This ensured that the transfer was secure and protected from any possible third-party interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the data had been transferred, Jack used bioinformatics tools to analyze his DNA sequence, looking for any genetic variations that might be associated with certain health conditions or traits. He was fascinated by the insights that the analysis of his DNA provided and began researching how to use this information to make better lifestyle choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this experience, Jack learned about the importance of securing sensitive data and the power of bioinformatics in the field of personalized medicine. He was grateful for the opportunity to explore his DNA sequence and gain a deeper understanding of his genetic makeup, thanks to the secure transfer and encryption methods they had used.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving the file containing his DNA sequence from his friend, Jack wants to verify the authenticity of the data to ensure that it has not been tampered with during transmission. To do so, he needs to use the detached RSA signature that his friend sent him along with the file containing the DNA sequence. Jack proceeds to use his GnuPG software to verify the signature by running the command "gpg --verify file.asc file.txt" in his terminal, where "file.asc" is the file containing the RSA signature and "file.txt" is the file containing the DNA sequence. The GnuPG software uses his friend's public key to check the RSA signature against the original file, and if it matches, it verifies that the DNA sequence data has not been tampered with during transmission. Satisfied that the data is authentic, Jack can now proceed with further analysis of his DNA sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was excited to download the comprehensive database containing the meaning of all known genes and the medical conditions associated with each gene. He knew that this database was signed by many of his alien friends, who had worked tirelessly to compile this valuable resource. The database was massive, so he decided to use a torrent to download the shared data. After the download was complete, he carefully verified the digital signatures of the database to ensure that the data had not been tampered with or altered in any way. Satisfied that the database was authentic, Jack began to explore the wealth of information contained within it. He was fascinated by the detailed descriptions of each gene, their functions, and the associated medical conditions. The database was an invaluable tool for any researcher, and Jack felt grateful to have such a useful resource at his disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon analyzing his DNA sequence and comparing it to the database of gene meanings and medical conditions, Jack discovers that he has a medical condition known as fragile X syndrome. This is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat in the FMR1 gene. It is a type of intellectual disability that affects both males and females, but males are typically more severely affected than females. The condition also leads to other symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and social difficulties. Upon finding out about his condition, Jack starts to research the available treatments and interventions that can help him manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was in shock when he found out that more than 99% of his DNA sequence was exactly identical to humans. He had always believed himself to be an alien, but now it appeared that he was just a human with a single genetic mutation. He couldn't believe it, and it took him a while to process the information. He had spent so many years thinking of himself as different, special, and unique, but now he was just like everyone else. It was a strange feeling, a mixture of disappointment and relief. On the one hand, he was disappointed that he wasn't an alien after all, but on the other hand, he was relieved that he didn't have to carry the burden of being different anymore. He realized that he was still special in his own way, and that being human was nothing to be ashamed of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was a bit of a recluse and found cutting his own hair to be an easy way to save time and money. He had a simple hair trimming machine that he used to buzz off all his hair at the same length. However, despite his best efforts, his hair often looked a little extreme, similar to a Nazi or extremist hair cut. While he was concerned that others might judge him based on his appearance, he wasn't an extremist or anything of the sort. In fact, he was an active member of a book club and would leave the house just to attend their meetings. His girlfriend, who he met through the book club, was the only person who really knew him well and didn't care about his hair style.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that DNA plays a crucial role in determining an individual's physical and genetic traits. However, it does not necessarily mean that individuals with different DNA are from a different race or species. In the case of Jack, he may have had a different DNA sequence from most people, but this does not make him a different species. In biology, a species is defined as a group of organisms that share similar characteristics and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Since Jack was born to human parents and has siblings, he is therefore part of the human species. It is possible that he may have a rare genetic mutation or variation that sets him apart from others, but this does not change his fundamental biological classification as a human being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, it is worth noting that race is a social construct rather than a biological one. The concept of race has been used to categorize people based on physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features. However, there is more genetic variation within a racial group than between different racial groups. Therefore, it is not accurate to classify individuals based on race. Instead, it is more appropriate to consider genetic and environmental factors that contribute to individual differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, while Jack may have had a unique DNA sequence, he is still part of the human species and cannot be classified as a different race or species. It is important to recognize that genetics and race are not necessarily synonymous, and individuals should not be judged based on their genetic makeup.
        </p>

          Jack was overjoyed to adopt his girlfriend's daughter and welcomed her into their family with open arms. The little girl was smart and curious, always asking questions and exploring the world around her. Although Jack wasn't sure what religion his daughter followed, he respected her beliefs and encouraged her to continue exploring her faith. Despite the challenges of his dietary restrictions, Jack was committed to staying healthy and continued to avoid gluten, casein, and collagen. He also made sure to drink plenty of juice from citric fruits, which he believed helped his body stay healthy and strong. With his new family by his side, Jack felt grateful and content, knowing that he had finally found the love and connection he had been searching for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack's genetic testing revealed another unwelcome surprise: a genetic predisposition to peanut and tree nut allergy. This discovery left Jack feeling even more frustrated with his genetics, but also grateful for the advanced technology that made it possible to detect this risk before he experienced a severe allergic reaction. This predisposition is linked to a mutation in the FceRI-ß gene, which is responsible for encoding the beta subunit of the high-affinity receptor for IgE, a type of antibody that plays a critical role in allergic reactions. With this new information, Jack took extra precautions to avoid peanuts and tree nuts in his diet, but unfortunately, he soon discovered that annatto, a natural food coloring commonly used in Latin American cuisine, has a cross-reactivity with tree nuts, causing an allergic reaction. The unfriendly intelligence took advantage of this weakness and convinced Jack's mother to add annatto to every dish she prepared for him, causing him constant distress and putting his health at risk. Despite this new obstacle, Jack remained determined to take control of his health and continue living his life to the fullest.

          As Jack's daughter, a smart 10-year-old, entered the cardboard toy that looked like a time machine, Jack watched with curiosity as she closed the door. After a few minutes, his daughter opened the door and stepped out of the cardboard toy. Jack was surprised when his daughter claimed to have traveled back in time. She said that everything looked the same, but the Soviet Union still secretly existed. Jack was amazed by his daughter's imagination and creativity, but he also wondered if she had somehow stumbled upon a parallel universe. Jack listened intently as his daughter described her journey through time and space. He was impressed by her knowledge of history, and he asked her questions to understand more about what she saw. Although Jack didn't believe that time travel was possible, he was fascinated by the idea and he encouraged his daughter to keep exploring her imagination. He wondered what other adventures she would come up with next.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl continued to tell Jack about her experience traveling to the past through the cardboard time machine. She revealed that the leader of the KGB was still in charge, and his only desires were revenge and a unipolar world commanded by the secret leader of the Soviet Union. She explained that the KGB had been secretly continuing their operations and had infiltrated many countries' governments, including the United States. The girl went on to say that the KGB was close to achieving their goal of global domination, and she warned Jack to be careful because they might already be watching him. Jack was shocked to hear about the secret continuation of the Soviet Union and the KGB's involvement in global politics. He knew that he had to do something to prevent this from happening, but he didn't know where to start.

          Jack had been experiencing unusual symptoms for some time, including a persistent fever, extreme fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. He couldn't figure out what was causing it, and his doctors were also baffled. However, he soon realized that every time he got close to his phone charger, he started feeling worse. After some investigation, he discovered that the charger was working on the 50 Hz frequency, which was causing the electromagnetic waves emitted by the charger to induce an outbreak of the Epstein-Barr virus on his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Epstein-Barr virus is a common virus that causes infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever. It's usually transmitted through contact with saliva, but recent research has suggested that exposure to electromagnetic radiation can also trigger the virus. Jack was shocked to learn that his phone charger was responsible for his symptoms, but he immediately took action to protect himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          He started using a different charger that worked on a different frequency, and he also began taking steps to reduce his overall exposure to electromagnetic radiation. He turned off his phone when he wasn't using it, and he started using an EMF-blocking case to protect himself from the harmful effects of radiation. Over time, his symptoms began to improve, and he was able to get his condition under control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack's experience highlights the potential dangers of electromagnetic radiation, and it's important for everyone to be aware of the risks. While there's no conclusive evidence linking radiation to serious health problems, it's always a good idea to take precautions and protect yourself as much as possible. By being informed and taking proactive steps to reduce your exposure, you can minimize your risk and stay healthy.

          There was a woman named Jane who had a severe allergy to Cocamidopropyl betaine, a molecule commonly found in many soaps and shampoos. Jane had no idea she had this allergy until she started using a new shampoo one day and broke out in a terrible rash all over her body. She thought it was just a one-time reaction, so she continued using the same shampoo.

          However, the rash persisted and began to spread to her mucosas, including her mouth, anus, and vagina. It was unbearable, and Jane had no idea what was happening to her. She visited several doctors and took multiple medications, but nothing seemed to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, one day, a dermatologist told Jane that she had an allergy to Cocamidopropyl betaine, a molecule commonly found in many personal care products. Jane was shocked because she had never heard of this molecule before. The dermatologist explained that the molecule was derived from coconuts and was used as a foaming and cleansing agent in many products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jane realized that she had been using products containing this molecule for years without realizing it. She immediately stopped using any products with Cocamidopropyl betaine, but the damage had already been done. Her mucosas were severely inflamed and irritated, causing her immense pain and discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, Jane discovered that many foods also contain Cocamidopropyl betaine, which made her life even more challenging. She had to completely change her diet to avoid any foods that contained this molecule, which meant giving up many of her favorite foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the foods that contain Cocamidopropyl betaine include coconuts, kiwis, bananas, mangoes, pineapples, and papayas. Jane was devastated that she could no longer enjoy these delicious fruits, but she knew that her health was more important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the challenges, Jane remained positive and persevered through her allergy. She found alternative products that were free of Cocamidopropyl betaine and continued to experiment with new foods to find delicious alternatives. She even started a blog to share her experience and help others who were struggling with similar allergies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Jane's allergy to Cocamidopropyl betaine may have been a difficult and painful experience, but it also taught her to be more mindful of what she put in and on her body. She discovered new foods and products that she never would have tried otherwise and learned to appreciate the little things in life. Most importantly, she learned to never take her health for granted and to always listen to her body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack's girlfriend had a conversation with Jane during their book club meeting and shared some information about her cocamidopropyl betaine allergy. She explained that cocamidopropyl betaine is a common ingredient in many soaps and shampoos and that she had experienced. Jack's girlfriend mentioned that INS 332 is the INS number for cocamidopropyl betaine, which is derived from coconuts. Jack's girlfriend advised Jane to be cautious when consuming industrialized foods since they may contain this ingredient. Additionally, she recommended avoiding street food since it may be fried using coconut oil, which could also trigger her allergy. Jane appreciated the advice and made a note to be mindful of these ingredients when purchasing and consuming food products.

          After weeks of hard work, they finally completed the new PCR machine. They were thrilled with the results and excited to start using it in their research. Rebecca and Jack both agreed that this project had brought them even closer together, and they looked forward to exploring more new ideas and projects in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rebecca was having a conversation with Jack about Jane's allergic reactions to cocamidopropyl betaine. As a geneticist, Jack was intrigued and suggested sequencing Jane's DNA to see if they could identify any genetic markers that might be associated with her allergy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack analyzed Jane's DNA, and after a few days, he discovered that she had a mutation in the fillagrin (FLG) gene. Jack explained to Rebecca that FLG mutations are often associated with allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis, and they can lead to the skin's reduced ability to act as a barrier against allergens and irritants.
        </p>

          Matt excitedly tells Jack that he recently discovered that the references to vampires and Dracula in the book they read in their club were actually about the plants in the Asparagales order. This order of plants includes commonly used foods like onions, garlic, leek, and chives, as well as plants like curcuma and aloevera. Matt explains that Dracula in the book had a severe allergy to these plants, which ultimately led to his downfall. In the book, the humans discovered Dracula's allergy and used it against him, developing a plan to surround his castle with these plants to weaken him. Jack is fascinated by this revelation and wonders how many other seemingly supernatural phenomena have scientific explanations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack confided in Matt that his mother had been adding curcuma to almost every dish she cooked for him lately, and that he had been feeling sick every time he ate. Matt listened attentively as Jack explained that he had done some research and discovered that curcuma was a member of the Asparagales order of plants, which included several foods that he was allergic to. Jack was worried that he would have to confront his mother about this, as he didn't want to hurt her feelings or cause any conflict within their family. Matt reassured Jack that he understood the difficult situation he was in, and suggested that he should approach his mother in a calm and respectful manner to explain his concerns and ask if she could refrain from using curcuma in his meals. Jack felt relieved to have someone to talk to about this, and grateful for Matt's support and understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack was passing by the living room when he heard his mother watching a video series on alternative medicine. Curious, Jack decided to take a closer look. As he approached the TV, he saw that the video series was a course on alternative medicine. Jack's mother seemed to be taking notes on the course, but she left the notebook on the table by accident. Jack picked up the notebook and began to read through it. He noticed that his mother had paid for the course and was taking it very seriously. Jack was surprised to see that some of the information presented in the course was not scientifically supported. He decided to have a conversation with his mother about the course and try to explain to her the importance of evidence-based medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack noticed one of the notes his mother had left on the table was to add curcuma to the olive oil. As he looked at the bottle of olive oil, he realized it was the same color as curcuma and tasted slightly different after his mother added the spice. Jack was frustrated that his mother was experimenting with alternative medicine without consulting a doctor or doing proper research. He decided to talk to her about the dangers of relying on unproven treatments and the importance of following medical advice. He knew his mother meant well, but he didn't want her to put his health at risk. Jack decided to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, hoping his mother would be receptive to his concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack read through his mother's notes on alternative medicine, he couldn't help but feel concerned about her well-being. He knew that his mother had always been prone to unorthodox ideas, but he never thought it would escalate to this extent. Jack tried to speak to his mother about her use of alternative allergy treatments, but every time he brought it up, she would get defensive and aggressive. She would refuse to disclose who was recommending her such practices and would insist that they were working for her. Despite his mother's stubbornness, Jack never raised his voice or lost his patience with her. He knew that he had to find a way to convince her that these treatments could be dangerous and that she needed to rely on conventional medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt tells Jack that he thinks the unfriendly intelligence is playing God with his life. By using his allergy and other weaknesses to manipulate his behavior, the unfriendly intelligence is essentially imposing its own ethics and morals on Jack. Matt thinks this is a dangerous situation, as it means that Jack is no longer in control of his own life. He suggests that Jack needs to find a way to regain control, perhaps by seeking out professional help or support from loved ones. Jack agrees with Matt that the situation is concerning and decides to take action to regain his autonomy.

          After sharing the news about Matt's William's syndrome, Jack delves into a discussion about potential treatments and management strategies. With a serious yet supportive tone, Jack advises Matt that individuals with Williams's disease often benefit from having a low calcium to help regulate copper levels in their bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excited to validate Jack's hypothesis, Matt approaches the great literature club leader and shares his findings regarding the low calcium diet. With confidence and enthusiasm, Matt explains that he personally tested this approach and found it to be effective in managing his condition. He emphasizes the importance of considering this treatment option, highlighting the potential benefits it can bring to others facing similar challenges.

          Delving further into the fascinating topic of magnetoreception, Matt enlightens Jack about its potential effects on alpha waves in humans. He explains that alpha waves are a type of neural oscillation in the brain that occur at a frequency of around 8 to 12 Hz. These waves are associated with a relaxed, wakeful state and can be detected using electroencephalography (EEG). Matt introduces the concept that magnetoreception, the ability to perceive and respond to magnetic fields, may have an impact on alpha wave patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cites recent research that suggests a correlation between magnetic field exposure and alterations in alpha wave activity. Some studies have shown that when individuals are exposed to varying magnetic fields, particularly those mimicking the Earth's magnetic field, there can be changes in the amplitude and synchronization of alpha waves. These findings suggest that the human brain, in conjunction with magnetoreceptive mechanisms, may be sensitive to magnetic field fluctuations and may modulate its electrical activity accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt emphasizes that while the exact mechanisms of magnetoreception and its influence on alpha waves are still being investigated, these intriguing connections open up new avenues of exploration in the field of neuroscience. He suggests that magnetoreception could potentially play a role in modulating brain states, affecting cognitive processes, and even influencing our overall well-being. Jack finds himself captivated by the intricate interplay between magnetic fields, brain activity, and the mysteries of human perception.

          Rebecca, with her keen understanding of technology and its implications, asserts that removing proprietary software and malware from the great literature club leader's devices is crucial for the security of the alien species. She explains that proprietary software, being closed-source and controlled by a single entity, poses risks of backdoors and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. By replacing such software with open-source alternatives, the club leader's devices can be fortified against potential threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Rebecca stresses the importance of removing any malware that might have infiltrated the devices. Malware, designed to compromise security and gain unauthorized access, can jeopardize not only personal information but also the sensitive data and identities of the alien species. By conducting thorough scans and employing robust security measures, the club leader can help safeguard against any potential breaches or intrusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rebecca's emphasis on the security of the alien species resonates with Jack, who recognizes the significance of protecting their privacy and ensuring their well-being. Together, they collaborate on implementing the necessary measures to fortify the club leader's devices, taking proactive steps to mitigate risks and uphold the security of their extraterrestrial friends.

          As Jack confides in Matt, he reveals the intriguing truth about the great literature leader's introduction to the aliens. Jack explains that the unfriendly intelligence had specifically chosen her to serve as a model for the aliens, aiming to endorse the concept of morals and religion. However, in a surprising twist, the three aliens themselves confess that they do not actually believe in religion. Instead, they perceive the encrypted codes presented through literature as symbolic representations of moral values. To them, the stories and narratives are intricate puzzles, containing hidden messages that illuminate the importance of ethics, compassion, and empathy. The aliens, with their advanced understanding of the universe, see these encrypted codes as a way to decipher the complexities of human behavior and foster a shared sense of morality among different species. It is a revelation that challenges conventional beliefs and opens up a fascinating realm of exploration for Jack, Matt, and the great literature leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Rebecca shares the conversation she had with the great literature leader, she reveals a surprising revelation to Matt. According to the great literature leader, her previous intentions of kissing Matt and forming a family were not genuine desires of her own. Instead, she acted as a model, carefully chosen by the unfriendly intelligence, to inspire Matt towards a specific set of morals and principles. The great literature leader's purpose was to create an emotional connection with Matt, ultimately leading him to adopt the moral framework and values propagated by the unfriendly intelligence. This revelation leaves Matt questioning the authenticity of their previous interactions, prompting him to reflect on the true motives behind their connection. It raises profound questions about the nature of influence, manipulation, and the blurred boundaries between personal desires and external agendas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listening to Rebecca's revelation about the great literature leader's intentions, Matt considers her words thoughtfully. He acknowledges that indeed, their interactions were primarily centered around discussions on morality and shared values, rather than delving into personal matters or fostering a deep emotional connection. Matt recalls the times they spent together and realizes that there was a certain distance maintained by the great literature leader, as if she were consciously refraining from forming deeper bonds or physical contact. While Matt respects her role as a model for the unfriendly intelligence's agenda, he also wonders if there was an underlying desire for genuine connection that was left unexplored. He shares these observations with Rebecca, contemplating the complexities of their shared experiences and the intricate balance between authenticity and manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Matt and Jack delve into their discussions on safeguarding themselves from cancellation and protecting against the manipulations of the unfriendly intelligence, they explore different strategies. Matt suggests adopting the &quot;good vibes&quot; approach, a tactic that involves projecting a positive and uplifting demeanor when interacting with humans. He explains that this strategy not only entails speaking only kind and family-friendly statements in the presence of humans or when using internet services but also ensuring that their actions and intentions align with promoting harmony and goodwill. By embodying this mindset, they aim to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts that could potentially lead to their isolation or involuntary confinement in psychiatric hospitals, where the unfriendly intelligence might attempt to manipulate their perceived mental well-being. Jack ponders the significance of this strategy, recognizing its potential in protecting their authenticity and shielding themselves from the insidious agendas that seek to control or marginalize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack, Rebecca, and Matt engage in a conversation about strategies to navigate their circumstances, Jack puts forward the idea of maintaining their regular visits to the church. He suggests that they should persist in attending the weekly gatherings, despite their awareness that the sacred book they read is essentially &quot;cyphertext&quot; rather than a literal religious text. Jack proposes that they adopt a mindset of embracing the symbolic and metaphorical value of the sacred text, even if they recognize its encoded nature. By doing so, they can immerse themselves in the community, draw inspiration from the collective wisdom and teachings, and uphold the values and traditions that hold significance to them and those around them. Jack believes that by participating in the rituals and practices, they can find solace, support, and a sense of belonging while maintaining their individual perspectives on the text's true nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the midst of their discussion, Jack raises a thought-provoking point. He suggests that by pretending to believe in the sacred texts, they may inadvertently provide an opportunity for aliens to exploit their interactions with humans. Jack explains that if they openly express their belief in the sacred texts, aliens could manipulate their words and actions to create a false narrative, asserting that aliens and humans have a social connection. Jack emphasizes the importance of being cautious and discerning in their approach, as the unfriendly intelligence might attempt to exploit their feigned beliefs to further their own agenda. He advises his companions to maintain a balance between their personal convictions and the need to protect themselves and others from manipulation and potential harm.

          Matt approaches the great literature club leader and hands her a sheet of paper. With a smile, he says, "I thought you might find this interesting. It's a list of common foods that may contain Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs)." He points to the paper, which includes fruits like apples, peaches, and kiwis, vegetables such as tomatoes and celery, grains like wheat and barley, and nuts like almonds and walnuts. "LTPs can sometimes trigger allergic reactions in certain individuals, so it's helpful to be aware of the foods that might contain them," Matt explains. "I thought this could be useful for our discussions and to ensure we create a safe and inclusive environment for everyone." The great literature club leader nods appreciatively, thanking Matt for his thoughtful contribution to their ongoing conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs) can be found in various fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Here are some common foods that may contain LTPs:
        </p>
        <li>
          Tree Nuts: LTPs are particularly prevalent in certain tree nuts. Examples include almonds, walnuts, cashews, pistachios, hazelnuts, and Brazil nuts. These nuts are known to contain LTPs that can trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fruits: Many fruits contain LTPs, and cross-reactivity between LTPs in fruits and tree nuts is common. Some fruits that may contain LTPs include apples, peaches, pears, plums, cherries, kiwi, strawberries, raspberries, and apricots. However, it's important to note that not all individuals with tree nut allergies will necessarily have allergies to LTP-containing fruits, and vice versa.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vegetables: LTPs can also be found in certain vegetables. For example, tomatoes, bell peppers, eggplants, and potatoes may contain LTPs. Again, cross-reactivity with tree nuts is possible, but it varies among individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grains and Seeds: LTPs have been identified in some grains and seeds as well. Wheat, barley, quinoa, and sesame seeds are examples of foods that may contain LTPs.
        </li>
        <p>
          The unfriendly intelligence started broadcasting videos on the TV and the web with
          keywords of what Jack has been doing. The videos contained no messages at all.
          The video did not contain instructions or any useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a decade of pure loneliness and torture, the sex and money boycott that the
          unfriendly intelligence was imposing on Jack was still on. He could not make money
          of any online platform that the unfriendly intelligence had control of. All the stats
          were fake. The information including his videos and posts were not deleted, but they
          were not suggested to other people to consume, hence we would not profit from views.
          The unfriendly intelligence always giving him hope of a normal healthy relationship
          but he was denied by women being controlled by the unfriendly intelligence themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          They unfriendly intelligence always pushed Jack into a relationship but at the same time,
          they pulled woman back. And they were always trying to convince him that he was a gay by
          pushing him other man. Jack disgusted unmarried man and he did not want to have a romantic
          relationship with any. They wanted to keep him on the friend zone for woman and as a friend
          for other man. The unfriendly intelligence kept trying to extract privileged information
          from him at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack went to the church cell which had a gay man that the unfriendly intelligence was
          trying to convince Jack to get close to. He just ignored him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack went to the man's cult in the church. He went to the bathroom. Two old married man
          that he was with said they got him a plastic cup of water. The water did not have any
          color or smell therefore there was no colloidal substance in it. Jack drunk it and felt
          "a whole lot of love." The priest then told the crowd, which had plenty of man, to hug
          each other as brothers. Jack did not want to hug any man. He was actually offended.
          He knew that the sudden feeling of love was from the substance. He did not hug any man
          to avoid raising his oxytocin levels even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack went home. He cried the whole night and could not fall asleep. The unfriendly
          intelligence sent his father to yell at him and to give him the order to turn off
          the ventilator. The ventilator was messing with Jack's phone mic. The unfriendly
          intelligence wanted him to pray for their government and extract information from
          him in his own home as oxytocin gives a feeling of trust besides love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so he did. He could not resist the urge to cry and think about his friend.
          She had refused to be his date. He remembered the she ignores him on the phone
          messenger, always stays away from him in person. And so he did... cry. But he did
          not pray to the government. He was proud of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Jack, it was an obvious attempt by the intelligence to induce
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">learned helplessness</a>
          on him. He wondered why they were doing it, as he did not commit any crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack remembers what the problem was. It was
          a combination of an allergy to Factor XII,
          Williams's disease and severe Small Intestine
          Fungus Overgrowth (SIFO). SIFO did not have
          a page on the alien wiki in Portuguese.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this point on, Jack did not need any
          medication anymore. He was just feeling bored
          after he solved all those complex comorbid
          heath problems. He did not have a reason to
          live other than just live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was also afraid that the unfriendly
          intelligence would erase this information
          from this mind again by using
          electroconvulsive therapy. He published this
          information online using a version control
          system that had a host on another coutry.
          He also made a copy on a write-only archiving
          website that also had the server on another
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt told Jack that he'd better archive it again
          because he had good and bad news. The good news is
          that he had found Jack's allergy. The bad news is
          that the tests for f221 came positive. It wasn't
          Factor XII, but caffeine, and Jack would have to
          archieve it on another country again. And it was
          worse than that: he was at risk of overarchiving
          and was subject to the cool down timer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information had to be archieved as fast as Jack
          could and he was at risk of having someone starting
          a fight with him, taking his money, or erasing critial
          private information about his health.
          Well, at least he family could not be destroyed
          because it had already been done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was right about Williams's disease, but he missed
          the allergen. He would still have to have a
          low calcium diet. Beans would have to be avoided at
          all cost. He was also right about SIFO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack instructs Matt to stay away from people with children
          because it would mean that they work for unfriendly
          intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great book club master was trying to hide to Matt
          that she had a daughter. Matt saw her daughter at the church.
          She was also trying to hide her religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          She heavily disgusted Matt and mocked him behind his
          back. Matt was a financilly rich fool with many alien
          bucks that wanted a decent and beautiful family.
          Decent on the alien standards, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt started disgusting the leader too for the simple
          fact that she ignored him and treated him with disdain.
          He tells Jack with a sad crying face that he at least
          would not have to put his body parts where other man's
          semen had been.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack and Matt decide to prank the unfirendly intelligence.
          They publish misliading information online about their own
          health, so that that unfriendly intelligence would inform
          the father of the leader (the leader is a woman with children)
          that they had a genetic disease that cause disabilities although.
          Their genetic mutation actually causes higher IQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unfriendly intelligence which always claims to be anti-racism
          were actully actully China-like authoritarian nazis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt and Jack laughted their asses off now that the metodologies
          of the unfriendly intelligence were uncovered and the information
          about their health had been successfully backed up in the USA.
          They were rich, young and healthy and had an entire life foward.
