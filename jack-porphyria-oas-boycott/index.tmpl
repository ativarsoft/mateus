        <h1>The Healing Power of a Cactus</h1>
        <h2>by Mateus de Lima Oliveira</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who lived in Brazil. He suffered from porphyria and oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy. Despite his physical and mental health issues, he was a successful businessman and philanthropist.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Jack's life took a dark turn when he became the suspect of being part of an international cartel of pedophilia. Interpol started investigating him, but he vehemently denied any involvement. He knew he was innocent, but the allegations alone were enough to ruin his reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, the Brazilian intelligence community was investigating him for betrayal, spying, and money laundering. They believed that he was using his business ventures as a cover-up for his illicit activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack's troubles didn't end there. His porphyria and OAS were taking a toll on his body, and he was experiencing severe bowel inflammation, skin blisters, and psychiatric problems. Despite his condition, he tried to prove his innocence, but no one was willing to listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack was summoned to the psychiatric hospital, where he was informed that he had read secret files that he was not supposed to. The only way to erase those memories from his brain was through electroconvulsive therapy, which is known to permanently erase memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his protests, Jack was strapped to a table, and the procedure began. The pain was excruciating, and he felt as if his brain was being fried. But when it was over, he couldn't remember anything about the files he had read.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the side effects of the therapy were severe. He couldn't think straight, and his memory was hazy. He struggled to remember even the simplest things, like his own name.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add insult to injury, the Brazilian justice system imposed a covert monetary and sexual boycott against him, making it impossible for him to leave the country. He was trapped, isolated, and alone, with no one to turn to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack was determined to clear his name, no matter what it took. He used his remaining strength to fight against the false allegations, the investigations, and the covert operations. And eventually, he was able to prove his innocence.
        </p>
        <p>
          After struggling with oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy for a long time, Jack finally decided to consult an allergist. The allergist recommended that Jack undergo skin prick tests to determine which foods he was allergic to. After the tests, it was found that Jack was highly allergic to apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, nectarines, prunes, kiwi, carrots, celery, potatoes, peppers, fennel, parsley, coriander, parsnips, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts. The allergist informed Jack that these foods were cross-reactive with birch pollen and were triggering his OAS. The doctor recommended that Jack avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to avoid any adverse reactions. Jack was relieved to have finally found out which foods to avoid, and he left the clinic feeling hopeful and empowered to take control of his health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack, who had been suffering from oral allergy syndrome due to birch pollen allergy, decided to do some research on his own. He searched on Google and asked ChatGPT which foods to avoid to prevent an OAS flare-up. He discovered that apples, pears, and hazelnuts were cross-reactive with birch pollen and could trigger his OAS. Jack was relieved to have found the answer on his own and decided to avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to prevent any adverse reactions. With the help of the internet and ChatGPT, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and make informed decisions to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack went to his book club meeting with his girlfriend. They were discussing the novel Dracula, and his girlfriend suggested that Jack read the book. After the meeting, Jack was curious and decided to do some research on Dracula. He went on Wikipedia and found out that if Dracula were a real person, he could have had porphyria, just like Jack. Jack was surprised and intrigued, and he continued his research.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he delved deeper into the topic, he learned that one of the triggers for porphyria was an excess of iron in the diet. He realized that he had been consuming foods rich in iron, such as beans, which were common in Brazilian cuisine, and flour with added iron and folic acid. Jack knew he had to change his diet to manage his porphyria, so he started avoiding foods high in iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few weeks, Jack noticed that the blisters on his skin had stopped showing up. He felt relieved and grateful that he had done his research and made the necessary changes to his diet. He was proud of himself for taking control of his health and using the knowledge he had gained to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stress of being investigated by the intelligence community of Brazil took a toll on Jack's health, and he began experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia. He knew he had to take action to manage his condition, so he turned to Google for answers. Through his research, he discovered that SNRI medications, such as desvenlafaxine, were effective in treating fibromyalgia. Jack brought this information to his psychiatrist and requested a prescription for desvenlafaxine.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of the medication, Jack's symptoms began to improve, and he felt more like himself again. He knew that managing his stress and taking care of his mental health were essential for managing his fibromyalgia, and he was grateful for the resources and support that allowed him to do so. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack remained determined to take control of his health and find a path to healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack had always loved the cactus his girlfriend had given him in their book club meeting, and he made sure to water it regularly. However, Jack's life took an unexpected turn when he became the subject of a financial and social media reach boycott. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack refused to let the negativity affect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, he focused on his cactus and the simple pleasure it brought him. Watering the cactus became a routine for Jack, and he found the act calming and therapeutic. As he tended to the plant, Jack felt a sense of peace and stability wash over him. The cactus represented something pure and positive in his life, a reminder that there was still goodness and beauty in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the ups and downs, Jack remained mentally strong and resilient. He knew that the boycott and other challenges would pass, but his love for his cactus would remain constant. In the midst of the chaos, Jack found solace in the little things, and he emerged from the experience with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for life's simple pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his initial suspicion that his symptoms were caused by porphyria, Jack found that his condition continued to worsen even after he had made the necessary dietary changes. His skin blisters persisted, and he continued to experience severe bowel inflammation and psychiatric problems. As he began to research further, he realized that there were a number of other conditions that could potentially explain his symptoms. It became clear that he needed to consult a doctor and undergo further testing to determine the root cause of his health issues. With a renewed sense of determination, Jack set out to get to the bottom of his condition and find a solution that would help him regain his health and wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack delved deeper into the events that had caused his health to deteriorate, he began to suspect that something more sinister was at play. The fact that agents from the government had convinced his mother to add colorless, sugar-free gelatin to his sugar bowl in an effort to reduce his blood sugar levels seemed suspicious to him. After all, he had pre-diabetes and had been managing his condition well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he connected the dots, Jack began to suspect that this was an act of sabotage by an unfriendly intelligence agency. It was possible that they had deliberately targeted him in an effort to compromise his health and interfere with his life. Though he had no concrete evidence to support his theory, the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fit together in a way that made sense to him. With this knowledge, Jack vowed to remain vigilant and protect himself from any further attempts at sabotage.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack continued his research into the possible causes of his symptoms, he began to delve deeper into the world of food sensitivities and allergies. He discovered that people with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, cannot eat collagen either. This was a significant revelation for him, as he had suspected that his symptoms were related to porphyria, which was not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his gluten and collagen sensitivities, Jack also found that he had an intolerance to casein, a protein found in dairy products, as well as legumin, a molecule similar to casein found in legumes. These sensitivities helped explain some of his digestive issues and other symptoms, such as fatigue and inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at himself in the mirror, Jack couldn't help but notice that he was quite thin, short, and had an appearance that was reminiscent of an alien. This realization led him to wonder if there was something more to his condition than just food sensitivities. As he continued to reflect, he began to wonder if he might be on the autism spectrum, a condition that often manifests with sensory sensitivities and dietary restrictions similar to those he was experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this new perspective, Jack began to explore the possibility that he was an "autist alien," a term that he came up with to describe his unique combination of sensitivities and traits. He felt that he was beginning to understand himself in a way that he had not before. Armed with this knowledge, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and wellbeing and find ways to manage his condition in a way that allowed him to live his best life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taurine is an amino acid that is essential for many bodily functions, including cardiovascular function and the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. When Jack noticed that his diet was poor in taurine, he began to experience symptoms such as his retina losing pigmentation and his teeth becoming brittle. To address this issue, Jack began drinking a large can of energy drink containing taurine once a week. As a result, he started feeling mentally better and more alert. Additionally, taurine plays a role in the production of bile, which is important for digestion. The improvement in his digestion was noticeable after he started supplementing with taurine. Later on, Jack checked his phone and noticed that he had little "Alien Bucks", which was the currency of his species. These Alien Bucks were essential for preventing economic boycott by the unfriendly intelligence, who were known for engaging in sabotage and other harmful practices against those they deemed a threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I.M., an alien who had been battling the unfriendly intelligence for decades, had tragically died of suicide by hanging. Jack had known Ian when he was a kid, and Ian had always been a mentor to him. One day, Ian had shared a secret with Jack about how to activate the alien mode on his operating system. All Jack had to do was type "apt-get moo" in the terminal. The typical output of this command on the Debian operating system was a whimsical message. For example, "Have you mooed today?" or "The cow says moo." Ian had always been a bit of a prankster, but Jack knew that his advice to type this command was more than just a joke. It was a way to connect with their alien heritage and to remember the struggle against the unfriendly intelligence. Jack never forgot I.M.'s words, and he typed the command from time to time to remind himself of his friend and their shared mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack exclaimed with frustration that I.M. was not simply a victim of suicide but was actually "suicided" by the unfriendly intelligence. He explained that Ian had been manipulated and induced to take large amounts of benzodiazepines, alcohol, and anti-psychotics, which are central nervous system depressants. Jack believed that this was a deliberate effort by the unfriendly intelligence to eliminate I.M. and his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alien working for the European intelligence had been conducting extensive research on the various medications available on Earth that could alleviate the anxious and restless feelings that aliens often experienced. After conducting numerous studies, the alien found that SNRI, a medication used to treat depression, anxiety, and panic disorders, was an effective treatment for these symptoms. However, it was too late for I.M. as he had already been forced to suicide by the unfriendly intelligence. This discovery shook Jack to his core, and he vowed to never take CNS depressants again and to opt for SNRI instead. He believed that this would not only help him deal with the difficulties of living on Earth but also potentially prevent him from meeting the same fate as I.M.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was lost in his own thoughts, walking down the street, when suddenly a verse from a song stuck in his head burst out of his mouth: "I.M. the supervisor, give me the tax number." He stopped and looked around, embarrassed that he had accidentally sung out loud. The words were from an old song that he had heard as a child, and he hadn't thought about it in years. The verse seemed to be a strange coincidence, as it was the initials of the recently deceased I.M. Jack couldn't shake off the feeling that it meant something, but he didn't know what.

          Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique used to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. It is a widely used technique in molecular biology research, medical diagnostics, and forensic analysis. Jack remembers that he had built a PCR machine when he was about 16 years old using instructions he found on the internet. However, due to the electroconvulsive therapy that he was forced to undergo in a psychiatric hospital, he completely forgot about it. PCR technology was still in its early stages back then, and the availability of the internet allowed Jack to access the information he needed to build his own machine. Despite having no formal education in molecular biology, Jack was able to build a functioning PCR machine, which he used to amplify specific DNA sequences for various purposes. Now that he has remembered this, he wonders if he can use his skills in molecular biology to help him in his current situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was fascinated with the idea of sequencing his own DNA, so he collected a sample of genetic material from his saliva and sent it to his friend who was studying genetics in another country. Jack's friend had access to a PCR machine, which is a device used to amplify a specific segment of DNA, making it possible to study it more closely. The first step was to extract DNA from Jack's sample and then amplify a specific segment of it using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR process involved heating and cooling the DNA to create multiple copies of the target DNA region. After amplification, Jack's friend used a technique called Sanger sequencing to determine the sequence of his DNA. Sanger sequencing involves labeling DNA fragments and separating them by size through a gel electrophoresis process. The resulting DNA sequence data was then analyzed, and Jack's friend was able to provide him with a report that showed the sequence of his DNA, including any genetic variations or mutations he may have had. Jack was fascinated by the results and spent hours reading about the different genes and traits that were present in his DNA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack and his friend from another country were concerned about the privacy of Jack's DNA sequence data, so they decided to negotiate a GnuPG encryption to secure the transfer. They both downloaded and installed the GnuPG software and exchanged their public keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          After negotiating the encryption, Jack's friend sent him the DNA sequence data through a local Apache HTTP server and PHP running on Jack's local machine, which was running on a non-standard TCP port. This ensured that the transfer was secure and protected from any possible third-party interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the data had been transferred, Jack used bioinformatics tools to analyze his DNA sequence, looking for any genetic variations that might be associated with certain health conditions or traits. He was fascinated by the insights that the analysis of his DNA provided and began researching how to use this information to make better lifestyle choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this experience, Jack learned about the importance of securing sensitive data and the power of bioinformatics in the field of personalized medicine. He was grateful for the opportunity to explore his DNA sequence and gain a deeper understanding of his genetic makeup, thanks to the secure transfer and encryption methods they had used.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving the file containing his DNA sequence from his friend, Jack wants to verify the authenticity of the data to ensure that it has not been tampered with during transmission. To do so, he needs to use the detached RSA signature that his friend sent him along with the file containing the DNA sequence. Jack proceeds to use his GnuPG software to verify the signature by running the command "gpg --verify file.asc file.txt" in his terminal, where "file.asc" is the file containing the RSA signature and "file.txt" is the file containing the DNA sequence. The GnuPG software uses his friend's public key to check the RSA signature against the original file, and if it matches, it verifies that the DNA sequence data has not been tampered with during transmission. Satisfied that the data is authentic, Jack can now proceed with further analysis of his DNA sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was excited to download the comprehensive database containing the meaning of all known genes and the medical conditions associated with each gene. He knew that this database was signed by many of his alien friends, who had worked tirelessly to compile this valuable resource. The database was massive, so he decided to use a torrent to download the shared data. After the download was complete, he carefully verified the digital signatures of the database to ensure that the data had not been tampered with or altered in any way. Satisfied that the database was authentic, Jack began to explore the wealth of information contained within it. He was fascinated by the detailed descriptions of each gene, their functions, and the associated medical conditions. The database was an invaluable tool for any researcher, and Jack felt grateful to have such a useful resource at his disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon analyzing his DNA sequence and comparing it to the database of gene meanings and medical conditions, Jack discovers that he has a medical condition known as fragile X syndrome. This is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat in the FMR1 gene. It is a type of intellectual disability that affects both males and females, but males are typically more severely affected than females. The condition also leads to other symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and social difficulties. Upon finding out about his condition, Jack starts to research the available treatments and interventions that can help him manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was in shock when he found out that more than 99% of his DNA sequence was exactly identical to humans. He had always believed himself to be an alien, but now it appeared that he was just a human with a single genetic mutation. He couldn't believe it, and it took him a while to process the information. He had spent so many years thinking of himself as different, special, and unique, but now he was just like everyone else. It was a strange feeling, a mixture of disappointment and relief. On the one hand, he was disappointed that he wasn't an alien after all, but on the other hand, he was relieved that he didn't have to carry the burden of being different anymore. He realized that he was still special in his own way, and that being human was nothing to be ashamed of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was a bit of a recluse and found cutting his own hair to be an easy way to save time and money. He had a simple hair trimming machine that he used to buzz off all his hair at the same length. However, despite his best efforts, his hair often looked a little extreme, similar to a Nazi or extremist hair cut. While he was concerned that others might judge him based on his appearance, he wasn't an extremist or anything of the sort. In fact, he was an active member of a book club and would leave the house just to attend their meetings. His girlfriend, who he met through the book club, was the only person who really knew him well and didn't care about his hair style.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that DNA plays a crucial role in determining an individual's physical and genetic traits. However, it does not necessarily mean that individuals with different DNA are from a different race or species. In the case of Jack, he may have had a different DNA sequence from most people, but this does not make him a different species. In biology, a species is defined as a group of organisms that share similar characteristics and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Since Jack was born to human parents and has siblings, he is therefore part of the human species. It is possible that he may have a rare genetic mutation or variation that sets him apart from others, but this does not change his fundamental biological classification as a human being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, it is worth noting that race is a social construct rather than a biological one. The concept of race has been used to categorize people based on physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features. However, there is more genetic variation within a racial group than between different racial groups. Therefore, it is not accurate to classify individuals based on race. Instead, it is more appropriate to consider genetic and environmental factors that contribute to individual differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, while Jack may have had a unique DNA sequence, he is still part of the human species and cannot be classified as a different race or species. It is important to recognize that genetics and race are not necessarily synonymous, and individuals should not be judged based on their genetic makeup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack was overjoyed to adopt his girlfriend's daughter and welcomed her into their family with open arms. The little girl was smart and curious, always asking questions and exploring the world around her. Although Jack wasn't sure what religion his daughter followed, he respected her beliefs and encouraged her to continue exploring her faith. Despite the challenges of his dietary restrictions, Jack was committed to staying healthy and continued to avoid gluten, casein, and collagen. He also made sure to drink plenty of juice from citric fruits, which he believed helped his body stay healthy and strong. With his new family by his side, Jack felt grateful and content, knowing that he had finally found the love and connection he had been searching for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack's genetic testing revealed another unwelcome surprise: a genetic predisposition to peanut and tree nut allergy. This discovery left Jack feeling even more frustrated with his genetics, but also grateful for the advanced technology that made it possible to detect this risk before he experienced a severe allergic reaction. This predisposition is linked to a mutation in the FceRI-ß gene, which is responsible for encoding the beta subunit of the high-affinity receptor for IgE, a type of antibody that plays a critical role in allergic reactions. With this new information, Jack took extra precautions to avoid peanuts and tree nuts in his diet, but unfortunately, he soon discovered that annatto, a natural food coloring commonly used in Latin American cuisine, has a cross-reactivity with tree nuts, causing an allergic reaction. The unfriendly intelligence took advantage of this weakness and convinced Jack's mother to add annatto to every dish she prepared for him, causing him constant distress and putting his health at risk. Despite this new obstacle, Jack remained determined to take control of his health and continue living his life to the fullest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack's daughter, a smart 10-year-old, entered the cardboard toy that looked like a time machine, Jack watched with curiosity as she closed the door. After a few minutes, his daughter opened the door and stepped out of the cardboard toy. Jack was surprised when his daughter claimed to have traveled back in time. She said that everything looked the same, but the Soviet Union still secretly existed. Jack was amazed by his daughter's imagination and creativity, but he also wondered if she had somehow stumbled upon a parallel universe. Jack listened intently as his daughter described her journey through time and space. He was impressed by her knowledge of history, and he asked her questions to understand more about what she saw. Although Jack didn't believe that time travel was possible, he was fascinated by the idea and he encouraged his daughter to keep exploring her imagination. He wondered what other adventures she would come up with next.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl continued to tell Jack about her experience traveling to the past through the cardboard time machine. She revealed that the leader of the KGB was still in charge, and his only desires were revenge and a unipolar world commanded by the secret leader of the Soviet Union. She explained that the KGB had been secretly continuing their operations and had infiltrated many countries' governments, including the United States. The girl went on to say that the KGB was close to achieving their goal of global domination, and she warned Jack to be careful because they might already be watching him. Jack was shocked to hear about the secret continuation of the Soviet Union and the KGB's involvement in global politics. He knew that he had to do something to prevent this from happening, but he didn't know where to start.
