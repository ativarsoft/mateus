        <h1>The Healing Power of a Cactus</h1>
        <h2>by Mateus de Lima Oliveira</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who lived in Brazil. He suffered from porphyria and oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy. Despite his physical and mental health issues, he was a successful businessman and philanthropist.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Jack's life took a dark turn when he became the suspect of being part of an international cartel of pedophilia. Interpol started investigating him, but he vehemently denied any involvement. He knew he was innocent, but the allegations alone were enough to ruin his reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, the Brazilian intelligence community was investigating him for betrayal, spying, and money laundering. They believed that he was using his business ventures as a cover-up for his illicit activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack's troubles didn't end there. His porphyria and OAS were taking a toll on his body, and he was experiencing severe bowel inflammation, skin blisters, and psychiatric problems. Despite his condition, he tried to prove his innocence, but no one was willing to listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack was summoned to the psychiatric hospital, where he was informed that he had read secret files that he was not supposed to. The only way to erase those memories from his brain was through electroconvulsive therapy, which is known to permanently erase memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his protests, Jack was strapped to a table, and the procedure began. The pain was excruciating, and he felt as if his brain was being fried. But when it was over, he couldn't remember anything about the files he had read.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the side effects of the therapy were severe. He couldn't think straight, and his memory was hazy. He struggled to remember even the simplest things, like his own name.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add insult to injury, the Brazilian justice system imposed a covert monetary and sexual boycott against him, making it impossible for him to leave the country. He was trapped, isolated, and alone, with no one to turn to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack was determined to clear his name, no matter what it took. He used his remaining strength to fight against the false allegations, the investigations, and the covert operations. And eventually, he was able to prove his innocence.
        </p>
        <p>
          After struggling with oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy for a long time, Jack finally decided to consult an allergist. The allergist recommended that Jack undergo skin prick tests to determine which foods he was allergic to. After the tests, it was found that Jack was highly allergic to apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, nectarines, prunes, kiwi, carrots, celery, potatoes, peppers, fennel, parsley, coriander, parsnips, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts. The allergist informed Jack that these foods were cross-reactive with birch pollen and were triggering his OAS. The doctor recommended that Jack avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to avoid any adverse reactions. Jack was relieved to have finally found out which foods to avoid, and he left the clinic feeling hopeful and empowered to take control of his health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack, who had been suffering from oral allergy syndrome due to birch pollen allergy, decided to do some research on his own. He searched on Google and asked ChatGPT which foods to avoid to prevent an OAS flare-up. He discovered that apples, pears, and hazelnuts were cross-reactive with birch pollen and could trigger his OAS. Jack was relieved to have found the answer on his own and decided to avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to prevent any adverse reactions. With the help of the internet and ChatGPT, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and make informed decisions to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack went to his book club meeting with his girlfriend. They were discussing the novel Dracula, and his girlfriend suggested that Jack read the book. After the meeting, Jack was curious and decided to do some research on Dracula. He went on Wikipedia and found out that if Dracula were a real person, he could have had porphyria, just like Jack. Jack was surprised and intrigued, and he continued his research.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he delved deeper into the topic, he learned that one of the triggers for porphyria was an excess of iron in the diet. He realized that he had been consuming foods rich in iron, such as beans, which were common in Brazilian cuisine, and flour with added iron and folic acid. Jack knew he had to change his diet to manage his porphyria, so he started avoiding foods high in iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few weeks, Jack noticed that the blisters on his skin had stopped showing up. He felt relieved and grateful that he had done his research and made the necessary changes to his diet. He was proud of himself for taking control of his health and using the knowledge he had gained to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stress of being investigated by the intelligence community of Brazil took a toll on Jack's health, and he began experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia. He knew he had to take action to manage his condition, so he turned to Google for answers. Through his research, he discovered that SNRI medications, such as desvenlafaxine, were effective in treating fibromyalgia. Jack brought this information to his psychiatrist and requested a prescription for desvenlafaxine.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of the medication, Jack's symptoms began to improve, and he felt more like himself again. He knew that managing his stress and taking care of his mental health were essential for managing his fibromyalgia, and he was grateful for the resources and support that allowed him to do so. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack remained determined to take control of his health and find a path to healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack had always loved the cactus his girlfriend had given him in their book club meeting, and he made sure to water it regularly. However, Jack's life took an unexpected turn when he became the subject of a financial and social media reach boycott. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack refused to let the negativity affect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, he focused on his cactus and the simple pleasure it brought him. Watering the cactus became a routine for Jack, and he found the act calming and therapeutic. As he tended to the plant, Jack felt a sense of peace and stability wash over him. The cactus represented something pure and positive in his life, a reminder that there was still goodness and beauty in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the ups and downs, Jack remained mentally strong and resilient. He knew that the boycott and other challenges would pass, but his love for his cactus would remain constant. In the midst of the chaos, Jack found solace in the little things, and he emerged from the experience with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for life's simple pleasures.
