        <h1>The Healing Power of a Cactus</h1>
        <h2>by Mateus de Lima Oliveira</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who lived in Brazil. He suffered from porphyria and oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy. Despite his physical and mental health issues, he was a successful businessman and philanthropist.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Jack's life took a dark turn when he became the suspect of being part of an international cartel of pedophilia. Interpol started investigating him, but he vehemently denied any involvement. He knew he was innocent, but the allegations alone were enough to ruin his reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, the Brazilian intelligence community was investigating him for betrayal, spying, and money laundering. They believed that he was using his business ventures as a cover-up for his illicit activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack's troubles didn't end there. His porphyria and OAS were taking a toll on his body, and he was experiencing severe bowel inflammation, skin blisters, and psychiatric problems. Despite his condition, he tried to prove his innocence, but no one was willing to listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack was summoned to the psychiatric hospital, where he was informed that he had read secret files that he was not supposed to. The only way to erase those memories from his brain was through electroconvulsive therapy, which is known to permanently erase memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his protests, Jack was strapped to a table, and the procedure began. The pain was excruciating, and he felt as if his brain was being fried. But when it was over, he couldn't remember anything about the files he had read.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the side effects of the therapy were severe. He couldn't think straight, and his memory was hazy. He struggled to remember even the simplest things, like his own name.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add insult to injury, the Brazilian justice system imposed a covert monetary and sexual boycott against him, making it impossible for him to leave the country. He was trapped, isolated, and alone, with no one to turn to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jack was determined to clear his name, no matter what it took. He used his remaining strength to fight against the false allegations, the investigations, and the covert operations. And eventually, he was able to prove his innocence.
        </p>
        <p>
          After struggling with oral allergy syndrome caused by birch pollen allergy for a long time, Jack finally decided to consult an allergist. The allergist recommended that Jack undergo skin prick tests to determine which foods he was allergic to. After the tests, it was found that Jack was highly allergic to apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, nectarines, prunes, kiwi, carrots, celery, potatoes, peppers, fennel, parsley, coriander, parsnips, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts. The allergist informed Jack that these foods were cross-reactive with birch pollen and were triggering his OAS. The doctor recommended that Jack avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to avoid any adverse reactions. Jack was relieved to have finally found out which foods to avoid, and he left the clinic feeling hopeful and empowered to take control of his health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack, who had been suffering from oral allergy syndrome due to birch pollen allergy, decided to do some research on his own. He searched on Google and asked ChatGPT which foods to avoid to prevent an OAS flare-up. He discovered that apples, pears, and hazelnuts were cross-reactive with birch pollen and could trigger his OAS. Jack was relieved to have found the answer on his own and decided to avoid these foods or cook them thoroughly to prevent any adverse reactions. With the help of the internet and ChatGPT, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and make informed decisions to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, Jack went to his book club meeting with his girlfriend. They were discussing the novel Dracula, and his girlfriend suggested that Jack read the book. After the meeting, Jack was curious and decided to do some research on Dracula. He went on Wikipedia and found out that if Dracula were a real person, he could have had porphyria, just like Jack. Jack was surprised and intrigued, and he continued his research.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he delved deeper into the topic, he learned that one of the triggers for porphyria was an excess of iron in the diet. He realized that he had been consuming foods rich in iron, such as beans, which were common in Brazilian cuisine, and flour with added iron and folic acid. Jack knew he had to change his diet to manage his porphyria, so he started avoiding foods high in iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few weeks, Jack noticed that the blisters on his skin had stopped showing up. He felt relieved and grateful that he had done his research and made the necessary changes to his diet. He was proud of himself for taking control of his health and using the knowledge he had gained to manage his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stress of being investigated by the intelligence community of Brazil took a toll on Jack's health, and he began experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia. He knew he had to take action to manage his condition, so he turned to Google for answers. Through his research, he discovered that SNRI medications, such as desvenlafaxine, were effective in treating fibromyalgia. Jack brought this information to his psychiatrist and requested a prescription for desvenlafaxine.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of the medication, Jack's symptoms began to improve, and he felt more like himself again. He knew that managing his stress and taking care of his mental health were essential for managing his fibromyalgia, and he was grateful for the resources and support that allowed him to do so. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack remained determined to take control of his health and find a path to healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack had always loved the cactus his girlfriend had given him in their book club meeting, and he made sure to water it regularly. However, Jack's life took an unexpected turn when he became the subject of a financial and social media reach boycott. Despite the challenges he faced, Jack refused to let the negativity affect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, he focused on his cactus and the simple pleasure it brought him. Watering the cactus became a routine for Jack, and he found the act calming and therapeutic. As he tended to the plant, Jack felt a sense of peace and stability wash over him. The cactus represented something pure and positive in his life, a reminder that there was still goodness and beauty in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the ups and downs, Jack remained mentally strong and resilient. He knew that the boycott and other challenges would pass, but his love for his cactus would remain constant. In the midst of the chaos, Jack found solace in the little things, and he emerged from the experience with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for life's simple pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his initial suspicion that his symptoms were caused by porphyria, Jack found that his condition continued to worsen even after he had made the necessary dietary changes. His skin blisters persisted, and he continued to experience severe bowel inflammation and psychiatric problems. As he began to research further, he realized that there were a number of other conditions that could potentially explain his symptoms. It became clear that he needed to consult a doctor and undergo further testing to determine the root cause of his health issues. With a renewed sense of determination, Jack set out to get to the bottom of his condition and find a solution that would help him regain his health and wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack delved deeper into the events that had caused his health to deteriorate, he began to suspect that something more sinister was at play. The fact that agents from the government had convinced his mother to add colorless, sugar-free gelatin to his sugar bowl in an effort to reduce his blood sugar levels seemed suspicious to him. After all, he had pre-diabetes and had been managing his condition well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he connected the dots, Jack began to suspect that this was an act of sabotage by an unfriendly intelligence agency. It was possible that they had deliberately targeted him in an effort to compromise his health and interfere with his life. Though he had no concrete evidence to support his theory, the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fit together in a way that made sense to him. With this knowledge, Jack vowed to remain vigilant and protect himself from any further attempts at sabotage.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jack continued his research into the possible causes of his symptoms, he began to delve deeper into the world of food sensitivities and allergies. He discovered that people with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, cannot eat collagen either. This was a significant revelation for him, as he had suspected that his symptoms were related to porphyria, which was not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his gluten and collagen sensitivities, Jack also found that he had an intolerance to casein, a protein found in dairy products, as well as legumin, a molecule similar to casein found in legumes. These sensitivities helped explain some of his digestive issues and other symptoms, such as fatigue and inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at himself in the mirror, Jack couldn't help but notice that he was quite thin, short, and had an appearance that was reminiscent of an alien. This realization led him to wonder if there was something more to his condition than just food sensitivities. As he continued to reflect, he began to wonder if he might be on the autism spectrum, a condition that often manifests with sensory sensitivities and dietary restrictions similar to those he was experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this new perspective, Jack began to explore the possibility that he was an "autist alien," a term that he came up with to describe his unique combination of sensitivities and traits. He felt that he was beginning to understand himself in a way that he had not before. Armed with this knowledge, Jack felt empowered to take control of his health and wellbeing and find ways to manage his condition in a way that allowed him to live his best life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taurine is an amino acid that is essential for many bodily functions, including cardiovascular function and the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. When Jack noticed that his diet was poor in taurine, he began to experience symptoms such as his retina losing pigmentation and his teeth becoming brittle. To address this issue, Jack began drinking a large can of energy drink containing taurine once a week. As a result, he started feeling mentally better and more alert. Additionally, taurine plays a role in the production of bile, which is important for digestion. The improvement in his digestion was noticeable after he started supplementing with taurine. Later on, Jack checked his phone and noticed that he had little "Alien Bucks", which was the currency of his species. These Alien Bucks were essential for preventing economic boycott by the unfriendly intelligence, who were known for engaging in sabotage and other harmful practices against those they deemed a threat.
