        <h1>Server location and SEO</h1>
        <h2>by Mateus de Lima Oliveira</h2>
        <p>
          Google and other search engines operate according to the laws
          depending on the server is. That also applies to search results.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a perfectly legal and nice website but the goverment
          where the server is represses and censors people, move the server
          and the DNS to a country or location where it is legal and the
          goverment in that location is not known for such practices.
